1. Use the arithmetic operators to calculate the sum, average CPU load given cpu_loads = [40, 60, 80].
2. Use the modulus operator % to check if a build number is even or odd (build_id % 2).
3. Use the floor division // to divide total log lines into chunks of 1000 for processing.
4. Use comparison operators to check if disk usage is above 80%.
5. Use logical operators (and, or, not) to check if (CPU > 70 and Memory > 80).
6 . Use assignment operators (+=) to incrementally add network packet counts.
7. Use the identity operator is to check if two service configs reference the same object in memory.
8. Use the membership operator in to check if "nginx" is in running_services = ["nginx","mysql","redis"].
9. Simulate auto-scaling: if current_replicas < desired_replicas, scale up by 1.
10. Use ternary operator: status = "ALERT" if cpu > 90 else "OK".
11. Combine multiple comparison operators: 50 < cpu < 90.
12. Use not in to ensure "debug" flag is not present in prod settings.
13. Use augmented assignment (*=) to double retry timeout every failed attempt.
