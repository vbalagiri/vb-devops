1. Use the arithmetic operators to calculate the sum, average CPU load given cpu_loads = [40, 60, 80].
2. Use the modulus operator % to check if a build number is even or odd (build_id % 2).
3. Use the floor division // to divide total log lines into chunks of 1000 for processing.
4. Use comparison operators to check if disk usage is above 80%.
5. Use logical operators (and, or, not) to check if (CPU > 70 and Memory > 80).
6 . Use assignment operators (+=) to incrementally add network packet counts.
7. Use the identity operator is to check if two service configs reference the same object in memory.
8. Use the membership operator in to check if "nginx" is in running_services = ["nginx","mysql","redis"].
9. Simulate auto-scaling: if current_replicas < desired_replicas, scale up by 1.
10. Use ternary operator: status = "ALERT" if cpu > 90 else "OK".
11. Combine multiple comparison operators: 50 < cpu < 90.
12. Use not in to ensure "debug" flag is not present in prod settings.
13. Use augmented assignment (*=) to double retry timeout every failed attempt.
16. Write a program that prompts the user to enter their height and weight, and then calculates and prints their body mass index (BMI).
 
17. WAP that calculates 
 a): Addition of two numbers.
 b): Average of three values. 
  
18. WAP that prompts the user to enter the radius of a circle and calculate then print the area and circumference of the circle.
Area = 3.14 * (radius * radius)
Perimeter = 2 * 3.14 * radius

19. WAP that prompts the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle, and then calculates and prints the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
Area = Length * width Perimeter = 2(Length + width)
