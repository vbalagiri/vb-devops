1.Automate checking status of 3 websites using loops.
2.Find the least CPU usage server from a list of monitored servers.
3.Use nested loops to print a multiplication table.
4.Find the max CPU usage server from a list of monitored servers.
5.Write a script using a loop to monitor disk usage every 5 seconds until it goes below 80%.
6.Use nested loops to generate all possible combinations of username and environment (dev, stage, prod).
7.Use a for loop to read a list of log file names and print only those ending with .log.
8.Use a while loop to retry connecting to a server until it succeeds (simulate 3 retries).
9.Use nested loops to simulate a matrix ping test between multiple servers.
10.Iterate through a list of Docker containers and print "Running" or "Stopped" status.
